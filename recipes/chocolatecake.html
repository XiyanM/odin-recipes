    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>2 cups white sugar

        1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
        
        ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
        
        1 ½ teaspoons baking soda
        
        1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
        
        1 teaspoon salt
        
        2 large eggs
        
        1 cup milk
        
        ½ cup vegetable oil
        
        2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        
        1 cup boiling water
        
        Frosting:
        
        ¾ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
        
        5 ⅓ cups confectioners' sugar
        
        1 ½ cups unsweetened cocoa powder
        
        ⅔ cup milk
        
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.
            Make cake: Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla; mix for 3 minutes with an electric mixer. Stir in boiling water by hand.
            Pour evenly into the prepared pans.
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to cool completely.
            While cakes cool, make frosting: Cream butter with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Stir in confectioners' sugar and cocoa alternately with milk and vanilla. Beat to a smooth spreading consistency.
            Split the layers of the cooled cake horizontally, cover the top of each layer with frosting, then stack them onto a serving plate.
            Frost the outside of the cake with remaining frosting.
